Coda is powered by its participants, and a community with strong values is important for success. We invite everyone in the Coda community to help each other and to create a safe and positive experience for everyone. Help new members by answering questions, offering guidance, directing them to resources, etc. We will be awarding 1000 pts\* points to the community members who best demonstrate our core values within the Coda community:

*  **Respect** \(1,000 pts\) - We respect each other; our inherent worth, abilities, time, and ideas. That’s why we stand for equality and fairness. Why we’re committed to decentralization. We act with integrity. We work hard to make things feel simple. And why we strive to be inclusive and accessible.
*  **Curiosity** \(1,000 pts\) - It’s what connects us all. Our obsession to understand, solve, and know. Our love of collaboration, open exploration, and objective engagement. Our attraction to big questions and “impossible” problems. Our passion to create technology and systems that serve everyone. Our insatiable drive to learn and grow. Our imagination, at work.
*  **Excellence** \(1000 pts\) - We don’t expect perfection. But each of us demands the best of ourselves. We’re here to create elegant solutions. Symphonic systems. Technical beauty. We’re committed to our community and to creating tech they can depend on. We enjoy the process. But we also deliver results.
*  **Openness** \(1000 pts\) - We believe in being open. In communicating proactively. Being responsive, available and accountable to the community. Empowering people with the information they need to participate. Sharing where we are in the process. Owning our mistakes. And collaborating to serve our vision with humility. It’s the only way to earn trust and create a fair future.
