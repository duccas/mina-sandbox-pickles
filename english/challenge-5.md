# Challenge \#5

### **Around the Globe Challenge**

A strong global community is paramount to our success, and Coda now has Genesis Founding Members in 36 countries! Help us to spread the word about Coda and branch out into new regions.

You could host a meetup for a region without any Genesis Founding Members. Create content to help new people understand and encourage them to join and participate in Coda—whether it’s through a blog, videos, podcasts, social media posts, etc.

Claim your points by letting us know about your meetups, blogs, videos, social posts, etc. By filling out [this form](https://share.hsforms.com/1_li5ShJxQn-iqemQmoekiQ4xuul).
